My name is Andreas, I'm working night shift at Volvo Cars in Gothenburg.
The whole reason I'm here is to become a great app devloper for iphones.
Sometimes I play games, old ones, here is a few...
- Might and Magic VII
- Heroes 3 of Might and Magic
- Age of Empires 2
- Roller Coaster Tycoon
- Keen: Space Commander
- Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth

Fantasy creations is very likable too me as you can see on the gamelist.

Time to work.
